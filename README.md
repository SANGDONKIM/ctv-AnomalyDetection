This CRAN task view contains a list of packages that can be used for
anomaly detection. Anomaly detection problems have many different
facets, and the detection techniques can be highly influenced by the way
we define anomalies, the type of input data to the algorithm, the
expected output, etc. This leads to wide variations in problem
formulations, which need to be addressed through different analytical
approaches.

Anomalies are often mentioned under several alternative names such as
outliers, novelty, odd values, faults, deviants, discordant
observations, extreme values/ cases, change points, events, intrusions,
misuses, exceptions, aberrations, surprises, peculiarities, or
contaminants in different application domains. These variants are also
considered for this view. The packages in this view can be roughly
structured into the following topics.

The deveolpment of this task view is fairly new and still in its early
stages and therefore subject to changes. Please send suggestions for
additions and extensions for this task view to the task view maintainer.
